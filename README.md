# Wordle Clone

This is a clone of the famous Wordle Puzzle app owned by The New York Times.

It was really exciting building this project as it challeneged my Vanilla JavaScript and DOM manipulation skills.

The project was built using basic knowledge of HTML, JavaScript and CSS. I used two external libraries for animation and toaster notification generation for error/information display (AnimateCSS and ToastrJS respectively).

It was cool to use JavaScript to dynamically create and populate the DOM with some elements

The project is hosted on GitHub Pages and here is the [Live Link](https://emmanueloloke.github.io/wordle/)
