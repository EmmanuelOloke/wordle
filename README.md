# Wordle Clone

This is a clone of the famous Wordle Puzzle app owned by The New York Times.

I really enjoyed building this project as it challeneged my Vanilla JavaScript and DOM manipulation skills.

The project was built using basic knowledge of HTML, JavaScript and CSS. I used two external libraries for animation and toaster generation for error/information display (AnimateCSS and ToastrJS respectively).

The project is hosted on GitHub Pages and here is the [Live Link](https://emmanueloloke.github.io/wordle/)
